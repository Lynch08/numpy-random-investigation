##### Background
This is my assignment project to Programming for Data Analysis module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2021.

This GitHub repository documents my initial research, project progress (git version control) and findings. As it is also a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to comment various functionalities also for my future reference.


##### Assignment objectives
The assignment concerns the numpy.random package, a part of NumPy library for Python.

See the Assignment Instructions [here](./ProgDA_Assignment.pdf)

The primary objective are as follows:

 - To explain the overall purpose of the package.
 - To explain the use of the "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions.
 - To explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.
 - To explain the use of seeds in generating pseudo-random numbers.
 - The detailed instructions can be found in the assignment description (pdf).

This project is intended to further familiarisation with data analytics. It is also intended to get familiar with the analytical tools, specifically the NumPy library and its random sampling module. The project will allow to get practical understanding of handling data in Python environment

As it is a learning exercise for me, I have made attempt to try and comment various functionalities not only for readability but also for my future reference.

The assignment has been carried out on Numpy version 1.20.1 ( last updated on 15-11-2021).

##### Assignment delivery
The project is delivered via this GitHub [repository] (https://github.com/Lynch08/numpy-random-investigation).

This README.md file contains background information and introduction to the assignment.

The assignment has been done within the Jupyter Notebook numpy-random.ipynb, stored in this repository.

In the notebook I have conducted the research and described the assignment progress. It is illustrated the applied concepts and methods together with relevant code snippets. The notebook includes also the calculated outputs and plots with accompanied description. Finally, inside the notebook I have included also references to sources being consulted for this assignment.

For viewing the notebook online, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks viewer, nbviewer. Paste the link to the notebook to be inspected into provided field.
